        "# Let's code XAI's Grok-1 Step-by-step in PyTorch\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of this guide is to illustrate the specific architecture choices implemented in Grok, which you will find are very similar to other open-sourced transformers such as the Llama, Mistral and Gemma series but with a few interesting differences. Check out the YouTube video where i walk through this colab notebook and explain everything step-by-step\n",

        "\n",
        "This notebook guide is designed for beginners; if you already feel confident coding a transformer in pytorch on your own then i recommend instead skimming through the model.py file in the [github repo](https://github.com/evintunador/minGrok) to see what makes Grok unique compared to other open-sourced LLMs. By beginner, i mean someone who understands matrix/tensor multiplication, general deep learning concepts like what a loss function is, and is capable of looking up pytorch documentation on any given function that they don't recognize, but maybe isn't well versed on transformers specifically. For an even better beginner's guide that uses an outdated architecture, check out [Andrej Karpathy's video on how to build GPT2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&t=5014s) and then come back here to learn about the more up-to-date methods that Grok utilizes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, check out the original open-source release of Grok [here](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-1) \\(spoiler: it's too big for you to run locally).\n",

        "**Note:** It's very easy to convince yourself that you understand something after watching a youtube video about it, but chances are you don't actually understand unless you can code it from scratch on your own. I highly recommend you mess around with this notebook and try to build your own minGrok from scratch\n",

        "Mixture of Experts is a very old idea in machine learning that became popular in transformers with [Mistral 7b](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-src) and supposedly GPT4. The idea is that instead of having every single parameter in the model contribute to the output, we allow some parameters to only come into effect based on their \"expertise.\" In practice what this means is that we instantiate multiple different traditional 2-layer feedforward networks with nonlinearities (\"experts\"), and then create a router that learns when to dynamically utilize different experts on a per-token basis. Usually multiple experts are selected by means of top-k choices where k is a hyperparameter designating how many experts to utilize (2 is the most common choice), however [it's also possible to implement a dynamic number of experts by using top-p instead](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07652.pdf)"
